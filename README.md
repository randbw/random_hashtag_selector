# random_hashtag_selector
Program written in rust to help a friend randomly select a specific amount of hashtags from a file.

### REQUIRES:

- rust

### TO USE:

- modify hashtags.txt so you end up with useful hashtags instead of stream of consciousness/objects in my room
- `cargo run`

### TODO:

- get file from CLI args. The file containing hashtags is currently located at ./hashtags.txt.
- release a binary so my non-technical friend user can more easily use it
